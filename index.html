                        <p class="info">As you may be able to see, bussiness is my passion. I enjoy finding new ways to incorporate this into my line of study. I plan to use the material gained in this course to expand my careers horizon in all areas. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have two dogs, a cat, and a child that I adore more than anything in the world. I love all kinds of art. Most importantly, I enjoy family gatherings, and sports.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Although I have had some struggles throughout my Coding Bootcamp, I have enjoyed the many projects I have had the pleasure of working on. I have developed a unique skillset that will set the pace of my future. No longer will I search for a new job, but for the beginning of my career.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To begin, a suitable postion may include, but is not limited to: Front End Web Developer, Back End Web Developer, JS Developer, and after a few years of practice,Full Stack Developer. After this bootcamp, I intend to take on other courses, such as a bussiness management degree. This will be followed by many certificates, such as A+, Network +, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Though my past job experience has not revolved around this industry, I intend to leverage all skills I have gained, such as my customer service focus, and profitable bussiness areas. I have also been able to update my <a href="resume 6.23.17">resume</a> to include all of my new skills.</p>
